            This plugin allows you to specify access control rules in a file. To use this plugin, add an
            etc/access-control.properties file containing two required properties: access-control.name, which must be
            equal to file, and security.config-file, which must be equal to the location of the config file. For
            example, if a config file named rules.json resides in etc, add an etc/access-control.properties with the
            following contents:
            access-control.name=file
            security.config-file=etc/rules.json
